Ok so in the child process
	- closes off descriptor for master side
	- calls login_tty for the slave pty

alright sweet

so we can write to some separate executable process
what can we do with this?

in this new executable process, we could:
	- repeatedly read what's sent to the process (read from STDIN)
	- fork off a python process and pass in the STDIN string to the process (easier to write)
	- do the processing in this process itself

then we'd have to rewrite our git-committing code in python
	- probably better to do this in C cause this might be called a lot


goals:
	- figure out how to programatically commit contents of current directory to _error branch
	- add in parsing so we only do the commit when the terminal output involves some error or exception
	- figure out how to store your changes in a manner that allows for machine-learning to be done
